# Research Findings: Local Search Plugin Selection

## Decision: Utilize `docusaurus-plugin-search-local` for local search and `@docusaurus/plugin-pwa` for offline capabilities.

## Rationale:

-   **`docusaurus-plugin-search-local`**: This plugin generates a client-side search index during the Docusaurus build process, making the search functionality entirely static and local. This directly fulfills the requirement for a local search solution.
-   **`@docusaurus/plugin-pwa`**: This plugin adds Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities, crucially setting up a service worker. The service worker caches the site's assets, including the search index generated by `docusaurus-plugin-search-local`, which enables the entire site (including search) to function effectively when the user is offline.
-   **Docusaurus Compatibility**: Both are either native Docusaurus plugins or widely adopted community plugins, ensuring seamless integration with the Docusaurus ecosystem and adherence to project conventions.
-   **GitHub Pages Compatibility**: Since both plugins contribute to a static build, the resulting Docusaurus site remains fully compatible with GitHub Pages deployment.
-   **Comprehensive Indexing**: `docusaurus-plugin-search-local` is designed to index Markdown content across docs and blog posts, addressing the need for searching all chapters and subchapters.

## Alternatives considered:

-   **Docusaurus default search (Algolia DocSearch)**: This solution relies on Algolia's external service and requires a backend for indexing. It is not suitable for an offline-capable, local search solution due as it conflicts with the "no backend" constraint and the offline requirement.
-   **Custom JavaScript Search Libraries (e.g., Fuse.js, Lunr.js)**: While these libraries could provide client-side search, integrating them into Docusaurus would require significant manual effort to manage indexing, UI integration, and ensuring full compatibility with Docusaurus's build process and theme. The chosen plugin approach offers a more streamlined and maintainable solution.
