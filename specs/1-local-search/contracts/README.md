# Contracts

This directory contains API contracts or interface definitions for the 'Local Search for Docusaurus Documentation' feature.

Given that this is a frontend-only local search implementation with no backend or dynamic API interactions, there are no explicit API contracts in the traditional sense (e.g., REST endpoints, GraphQL schemas). The interactions are primarily client-side between the Docusaurus theme, the local search plugin, and the PWA service worker.

Any "contracts" would be implicit in the configuration and expected behavior of the Docusaurus plugins themselves.
