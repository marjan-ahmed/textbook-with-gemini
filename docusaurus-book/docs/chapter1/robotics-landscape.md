### Trend 2: Vision-Based Navigation
Shift from LiDAR-heavy systems to camera-based perception (influenced by Tesla's approach).

### Trend 3: Mass Production Goals
Companies like Tesla aim for production-scale manufacturing to reduce costs dramatically.

### Trend 4: Foundation Models for Robotics
Research into "robot foundation models" that can generalize across tasks and platforms.

### Trend 5: Sim-to-Real Transfer
Extensive use of simulation to train behaviors before real-world deployment.

## Market Projections

The humanoid robotics market is projected to grow significantly:

- **2024**: ~$1-2 billion (research and early commercial)
- **2030**: Projected $10-20 billion
- **Applications**: Manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, domestic service

## Open Source Ecosystem

Several open-source projects are accelerating development:

- **ROS 2**: De facto standard for robot software
