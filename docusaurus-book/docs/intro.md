# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** course! This comprehensive textbook will guide you through the fascinating world of embodied artificial intelligence and humanoid robotics.

## What You'll Learn

This course bridges the gap between digital AI systems and physical embodiment. You'll learn how to:

- 🤖 Build and control humanoid robots in simulation and real-world environments
- 🧠 Apply AI models to physical tasks and embodied intelligence
- 🔧 Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) for robotic applications
- 🎮 Create digital twin simulations using Gazebo and Unity
- 💡 Integrate NVIDIA Isaac for advanced AI-powered perception
- 🗣️ Implement Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for natural robot interaction

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into four main modules over 13 weeks:

1. **ROS 2 — Robotic Nervous System** (Weeks 3-5)
2. **Digital Twin Simulation — Gazebo & Unity** (Weeks 6-7)
3. **NVIDIA Isaac — AI Robot Brain** (Weeks 8-10)
4. **Vision-Language-Action Robotics (VLA)** (Weeks 11-13)

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of fundamental AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with Linux/Ubuntu is helpful but not required
- High-performance workstation (see Hardware Requirements)

## Hardware Requirements Summary

This course requires:

- **CPU**: Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3060 or better (RTX 4070+ recommended)
- **RAM**: 64GB minimum
- **Storage**: 512GB SSD minimum
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Optional hardware for hands-on experience:
- NVIDIA Jetson for edge AI deployment
- Physical robot platform (Unitree Go2/G1 or similar)
